## Data analysis notebooks for COMM3130 Group Data Project
#### Project Authors: Saara Ghani, Kaitlin Blam


### Our Project is comprised of 8 notebooks:
#### Set Up (1_Set_Up.ipynb)
This file loads in and tokenizes the corpora (Dr. Seuss and comparison authors corpora).

#### Corpus Descriptors (2_Corpus_Descriptives.ipynb)
This file describe the elements of the corpus (number of tokens, number of types, token type ratio).

#### An attempt to adjust the pronunciation package (3_Adjust_Pronouncing_Package.ipynb)
This was an attempt to adjust the pronouncing package to incorporate the words made up by Dr. Seuss, but we were unable to do this successfully.

#### Global Analysis (4_Global_Analysis.ipynb)
This file analyses all of the tokens across the entire text for each of the 25 Dr. Seuss texts and 25 comparison texts.

#### Local Analysis Set Up (5_Local_Analysis_Part1.ipynb)
This file sets up a localized dataframe, by creating chunks of 20 words before and 20 words after each token in the texts.

#### Local Analysis (6_Local_Anlaysis_Part2.ipynb)
This file analysis the localized chunks to explore the word repetition, rhymes and rhyme repetition in Smaller sections of the texts. It also contains a bootstrap analysis of the localized dataframes.

#### Writing Our Own Dr. Seuss Poem (7_Writing_Our_Own_Dr._Seusss_Poem.ipynb)
Here, we explored the most frequent rhymes of Dr Seuss and created our own powm in his style.

#### Functions (comm3130_F24_Final_Project_Team5/data_analysis/functions.ipynb)
