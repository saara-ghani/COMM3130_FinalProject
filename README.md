Our aim is to determine whether Dr. Seuss is more rhyme-y than other children's writers. Does he repeat words more? Does he rhyme more? Are his rhymes more unique or are they repeated more than other writers?

As a bonus, we also generated two of our own Dr. Seuss poems, using the analysis we learned to match his rhyming technique.
