## Blog post an of your data story and creative output for COMM3130 Group Data Project

* This folder should contain the files that contain the outputs of all your data analysis. 

1. You should create an engaging data blog that stands alone (i.e. it doesn't require the reader to look over all your analysis notebooks).
2. Your creative output that presents you data story/findings in an engaging way. This could be a video, poster, web application, data dashboard, board game, song, etc, etc.

* Update this README file to describe the content.


### Description of this folder

We are creating a blog post that succinctly summarizes our findings and presents them in an engaging narrative format. We have imported png file versions of our results in the form of graphs, as well as a png file of Seussian images to make our blog post more visually pleasing to ur audience. These png files are attached in this folder.
